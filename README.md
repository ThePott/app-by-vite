# Assignment for NXRBootCamp React Basic course
This app is created by Vite(`npm create vite@latest`).

## You want to create react app with Vite too?
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) or copy following command.
```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
## Vite vs CRA
- Vite is faster in in install
- Vite does not bundle while in development, hence faster to check change

## Clone this app
In the project directory, you can run:
```bash
git clone {this-repo-url}
```
Then, change directory to cloned project and run
```bash
npm install
```

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
